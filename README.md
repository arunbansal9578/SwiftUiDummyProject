# SwiftUiDummyProject
A clean and minimal shopping app built entirely with SwiftUI, featuring seamless API integration, Core Data persistence, and a responsive, modern interface. This project demonstrates essential iOS development concepts like networking, state management, and local storage — perfect for learning and prototyping.

🌐 API Integration (GET Request) Fetches product data from a remote REST API using URLSession with lightweight error handling and loading indicators.
📃 Product List View Displays a scrollable list of products with thumbnail images and prices.
🔍 Product Detail View Tapping on a product reveals a detailed view including image, title, price, and description.
🛒 Add to Cart with Core Data Users can add items to their cart, which is stored locally using Core Data for persistence.
📦 View Cart & Place Order Retrieves cart data from Core Data and simulates an order placement flow.
